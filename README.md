This fall I joined Coursera Machine Learning class (https://class.coursera.org/ml-004/class) and since I don't have time to learn Octave
to complete home assignments, I've decided to give Python a try and to solve programming exercises using numpy and pylab.
Doing that I could hit to birds with one stone: learn Python and ML all together. 
Please, don’t forget about Coursera’s honor of code - https://www.coursera.org/about/honorcode.
